## static variables

The computer science bit

    A `static variable` is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning that its lifetime (or "extent") is the entire run of the program. Contrast to automatic variables, whose storage is stack allocated and deallocated on the call stack; and in contrast to objects whose storage is dynamically allocated and deallocated in heap memory.
