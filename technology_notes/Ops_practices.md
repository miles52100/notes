# GitOps, MLOps and DevOps

These are workflow practices aimed at:

* streamlining processes
* deployment
* development cycles etc

As the MLOps reference says

    MLOps can be considered an evolution of DevOps
    and is based on the same foundational principles:
    
    automation
    collaboration
    continuous improvement

    apllied to developing ML models

## MLOps CI/CD

In contrast to DevOps, CD is not about a single software package or 
service but is about a system, an ML training pipeline, that should automatically deploy another service.
