# IaC Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure - such as networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology - in a descriptive model, using a versioning system that is similar to what is used for source code. When you are creating an application, the same source code will generate the same binary every time it is compiled. In a similar manner, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice, and it is often used in conjunction with continuous delivery.
