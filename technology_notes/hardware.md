# Hardware notes

A somewhat random collection


## ASIC
Application-specific integrated circuit. A microchip designed for a special application.


## FPGA
Field-programmable gate array, a type of IC that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacture. Consists of an array of programmable logic blocks and interconnects.

## CPU
General purpose computing brain

## GPU
Specialised processor that accelerates parallelized computations.

## DPU
Processor that processes data that moves around the data center, such as network, security and storage functions.

## IPU
Infrastructure processing chips

## SmartNICs, IPUs, DPUs
See [here](https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/24/infrastructure_processing_units/) for a Register article on an interesting trend in data centres.

## P4 Programming Language and P4 PRogrammable Switch
A domain-specific programming language used to describe a programmable forwarding hardware processes: can be ASIC, FPGA or NIC
Stands for Programming Protocol-indepdendent Packet Processors.
