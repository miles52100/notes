# Generative AI

Trying to keep a reference to the ever changing landscape of new tools in generative AI that keep emerging.

## OpenAI

### Sora

## Google

### Astra

Uses Gemini 2.0's built-in agent framework to do Q&A and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to.

Gemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.

But the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them. 

And that’s where agents come in.
