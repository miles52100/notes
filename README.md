My notes on technical topics.
All are markdown files

Split into two subdirs:

## data_science_notes

To cover various data science and statistics concepts

## technology_notes

To cover technologies, coding, networking, operating systems, hardware etc.

### Managing these notes

These are maintained in a `git` repo and stored on LS BB

The intention is to CASTLE BLACK that BB repo from time to time.
