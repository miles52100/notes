# Coresets

To quote from the intro reference, A *coreset* or *core-set* **of an input set** is its small summation, such that

    solving a problem on the coreset as its input, provably yields the same result as solving the same problem
    on the original full set, for a given family of problems (models, classifiers, loss functions)
