# Retrieval Augmented Framework, RAG

A framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base in order to ground LLMs on the most accurate up-to-date info.

AWS provide a nice summary of RAG, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/).

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.
