# Dynamic Programming

A mathematical optimization method and algorithmic paradigm. Developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s.

>In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure. 

## Mathematical optimisation

>There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called "divide and conquer" instead. This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.

## Examples

  * Dijkstra's algorithm - solves the shortest path problem.
  * Fibonacci sequence
  * A type of balanced 0-1 matrix
  * Checkerboard
  * Sequence alignment
  * Tower of Hanoi puzzle
  * Egg dropping puzzle
  * Matrix chain multiplication
