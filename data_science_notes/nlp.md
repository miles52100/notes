- [On Small Depth Threshold Circuits](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/files/helsinki.pdf) Very old but possibly useful discussion on complexity of 2 layer NNs and functions.

- [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762#cite.wu2016google) The original paper that introduced the transformer architecture using encoder-decoder blocks as better than LSTM


## Metrics

[BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) Bilingual evaluation understudy. Standard for evaluating quality of MT on corpus against a range of reference translations. E.g. the S2S paper above references achieving a best yet BLEU score for a given task.
