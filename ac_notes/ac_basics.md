## Guidance

Use the AC Information Management [ACIM](https://ltpnetwork.sharepoint.com/sites/InformationManagement)
Guidance section for general tips.


## OS
macOS Tahoe v26.1

## KeePassXC

This is where I want to store all keys I create for various accounts.
See red book in my AC bundle.


## Install software

For installing on the device, use the AC Store app
Useful for checking what you have already installed on the device

## Documents, backups 
In ${HOME} folder there's a link to 'OneDrive' where you should store notes and documents
In addition or separately you can store files under Git and push to a remote BB repo.

## Day2Day admin/general notes

Apple's Notes app, used for recording Flexi and NWR links
MS OneNote also used for pasteing notes

MS Teams
 - chats
 - Channel groups

### Outlook email

### Atlasssian Tools

These are not managed by OneIT but by TDX.
They have a 

- [TDX Support Service Desk](https://jira.tdx.gss.gov.uk/servicedesk/customer/portal/177)
- [TDX Self serviec portal](https://portal.tdx.gss.gov.uk/)
- [TDX Channel](ihttps://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3A0e40c55640b4404097ba7958b1cf8a6e%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=6b1f9f5d-04e4-4e92-8166-50e7d5fb6717&tenantId=fad42abb-dfda-43f0-9120-b18e6e86169d)

#### Confluence

#### Jira

I think you need to request an account for this. In any event I have one.
There was no obvious project so using the self service portal above I requested one:
Porject Name = CAITO
Project Key = CAITO


#### BB

I need to migrate my personal code repos from this to GitHub

See [migration page](https://ltpnetwork.sharepoint.com/sites/DevExWestComms/SitePages/GitLab-Migration-Landing-Page.aspx)

### WestGTP

TODO

Understand when Atlassian tools expire

## Main Workflows

Aim to have three main areas to do work.
All except possibly the VM should be either stored on 'OneCloud' and/or maintained in a Git repo
with a remote on BB or my GitHub account.

### iTerm2 and Vim

### Mac: VSCode and JupyterLab

### VM: ?

TODO setup

## Technical Notes

Currently managed under Git and remote to BB.
Located  
'/Users/miles52100/OneDrive - Corp/Documents/notes/'

These contain my main technical notes covering primarily data science and technologies

## Code

Two main locations 

1. '~/Documents/Code'
2. '/Users/miles52100/OneDrive - Corp/Documents/Code/'

The latter is clearly backed-up.

Main subfolders in 'Code'

- ALASS
- Misc
- Notebooks
- Python
- Rust
- SALSA
- TmpCode

### VSCode

Using app from AC Store.

TODO - get integration with WestGPT


### JupyterLab Notebooks

Installed from the AC Store.
Although free use of the anaconda front end GUI has gone (see online about restricting use to payees only)
you can still create conda environments in JupyterLab app and hence install python packages to a virtual environment.

All notebooks are stored in 
'/Users/miles52100/OneDrive - Corp/Documents/Code/Notebooks/'

Current main subfolders are:

- MATH4350
- MISC
- PAPERS
- MNIST


## VMWare





TODO

- [ ] Migrate from BB to personal GitHub repo.
